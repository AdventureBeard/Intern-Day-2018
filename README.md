# Intern Day 2019

### Welcome to Plus1 Labs Intern Day 2019! 

Tomorrow you'll be teaming up with each other to take on a series of increasingly difficult software engineering challenges. You've already gotten past the general CS interview; we know you can write a DFS and prove P=NP and all that jazz. Today you'll be demonstrating your abilities as a software engineer--that is, parsing user requirements, spinning up requisite databases and web services, using version control, actually designing and writing software, making hard tradeoffs, and most importantly, communicating and working as a team. ༼つ ◕_◕༽つ

Before tomorrow, if you haven't already:
1. Create a Github account
2. Create a Heroku account

Some things you might want to read up on:
* Deploying apps to Heroku
* Working with Git and Github
* Model-View-Controller pattern

Don't go too crazy with research; be sure to get some sleep.  We want this experience to model what day-to-day life is on a fast-paced product development team, and not knowing everything before diving in is 100% part of it. We hope you enjoy the day and don't be afraid to ask questions.
